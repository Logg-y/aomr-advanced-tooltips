This is the repo beind the [Advanced Tooltips](https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/advanced-tooltips/264394) mod for Age of Mythology Retold. All this does is parse collected files (with some necessarily hand crafted exceptions) to produce a static string table override mod which can be loaded by the game. The idea here is that the repo can handle nearly all inevitable balance and number tweaks that are (for now at least) coming out every 3 weeks or so by itself without the need to do anything manually - except extract the new data and rerun after every update.

To use, copy `configtemplate.ini` to `config.ini` and fill out the fields. The data path expects a path to an extracted data.bar (or identically formatted collection of files). A program like [Resource Manager](https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/v-0-7-resource-manager-age-of-myth-retold-bar-extractor/260136) can do the extraction.
